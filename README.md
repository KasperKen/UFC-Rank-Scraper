# UFC Rank Scraper

Downloads a list of fighters from http://rankingmma.com/ and associates them with their weight class.

## No longer maintained
This project was created as a learning experience and is no longer maintained. I doubt it will still properly scrape anything at this point.

## usage

1. Run Bundle Install to install dependancies
2. Run ./bin/UFC-Scraper
2. Type in commands to list fighters, weightclasses, and more information like ranking and bios.
